## 🧠 Challenge Overview

- **Source:** Shpora C# challenge (Kontur)
- **Year:** 2021
- **Purpose:** Practice intermediate and advanced C# problem solving
- **Focus:** Algorithms, collections, loops, data manipulation, performance

Each folder contains a single challenge with a readable solution and, where appropriate, explanation of logic.

## 🗂 Project Structure

- `ChallengeName1/` — Task description + implementation  
- `ChallengeName2/` — Another problem + solution  
*(And so on)*

Each task includes:
- problem statement (if available)
- C# implementation
- relevant comments or notes

✔ C# core language features  
✔ Data structures and algorithms (arrays, lists, dictionaries, etc.)  
✔ Problem decomposition and logic building  
✔ Working with input/output  
✔ Efficient and clean code

---

## 📌 Example Topics

Tasks include solutions involving:

- string and collection processing  
- algorithmic logic and pattern matching  
- complexity considerations  
- edge case handling

*(See specific folders for details)*
